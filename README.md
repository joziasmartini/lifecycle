  An application that monitors your body and mind.

## Introduction

We all have problems and suffering, even so, no one could have imagined that a pandemic would arise, and as we were taken by surprise, we still haven't learned how to deal with it.

With fear, without hope, our body and mind did not rest well, our cycles became deregulated and we still cannot fully recover from what has been happening in the world.

Seeking to help people in need, we created the Mindstate app, which helps you monitor and regulate your body and mind for a more regulated and healthy life.

We decided to use the <a href="https://www.desenvolvimentoagil.com.br/scrum/">agile scrum methodology</a>.

In this project, the sprints lasted fifteen days each.

Much of the project was built following the ideas of <a href="https://dschool.stanford.edu/resources/dschool-reading-list">design thinking by stanford</a>.
