  An application that monitors your body and mind.

## Project

No one could imagine that a pandemic would arise, and as we were taken by surprise, we still haven't learned how to deal with it.

Afraid, hopeless, our body and mind hasn't rested well, our cycles have deregulated and we still can't fully recover.

Reaching out to anyone in need, we've built the Mindstate app, which helps you monitor and regulate your body and mind.

## Methodology
The project started with research to validate the pain of our personas.

For that, we made the following <a href="https://forms.gle/LFZA6vXYwy3s8vCn7">research</a>.

We decided to use the <a href="https://www.desenvolvimentoagil.com.br/scrum/">agile scrum methodology</a>.

In this project, the sprints lasted fifteen days each.

Much of the project was built following the ideas of <a href="https://dschool.stanford.edu/resources/dschool-reading-list">design thinking by stanford</a>.
