## About

This was a work done about the mental health in the pandemic for software engineering.

The members of this project are Jozias Martini, Gustavo Bevilacqua, Bruno Bevilaqua and Mateus Arthur.

Much of the project was built following the ideas of <a href="https://dschool.stanford.edu/resources/dschool-reading-list">design thinking by stanford</a>.

## Research

The project started with research to validate the pain of our personas.

For that, we made the following <a href="https://forms.gle/LFZA6vXYwy3s8vCn7">research</a>.

## Organization

We decided as a group to use Trello to organize the application files and projects.

## Methodology

We decided to use the <a href="https://www.desenvolvimentoagil.com.br/scrum/">agile scrum methodology</a> in the project.

The sprints lasted fifteen days each.

## Technologies

We used the following technologies in the project:

HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Firebase.

## Prototype

We made a prototype of the main screens in HTML and CSS.

## Pitch

The project had a final pitch presentation created by the members.

The objective was to present and attract investments from companies or investors.

## Installation

It is not necessary to do an installation to run the project's front-end.

To run the backend, you need to configure <a href="https://firebase.google.com/">firebase server</a>.
